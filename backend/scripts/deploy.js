//* How to change this file
/*
- Fill in the `ContractName` with your contract name.
- Uncomment the verification process if you want to verify your contract but make sure to uncomment the same in the `hardhat.config.js` and change the values as required.

You can pass in values into your contract like doing the following :
ex : Asssume you have a string and a number to pass
` const lock = await Lock.deploy("hello", 5);`
*/

//* Sample Deployment
/*
  const Lock = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("ContractName");
  const lock = await Lock.deploy();

  await lock.deployed();

  console.log("Contract Deployed to : ", lock.address);

  console.log("Sleeping...");
  await sleep(50000);
  await hre.run("verify:verify", {
    address: lock.address,
    constructorArguments: [],
  });

  const ExchangeContract = await ethers.getContractFactory("Exchange");
  const exchangeContract = await ExchangeContract.deploy(cryptoDevTokenAddress);
  await exchangeContract.deployed();

  console.log("Exchange Contract Deployed to : ", exchangeContract.address);
